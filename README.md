# Army Business Rules Online Checklist for SCORM 2004 3rd Edition CMI v1.2
This web form is an online version of the [Army BRBP SCORM 2004 CMI Checklist](https://tadlp.github.io/brbp/). It is intended to be used by the vendor's designated point-of-contact upon completing development of a DL product before submission to the Army.

The web form contains fields for the following information:

* **Course name:** This is the name of the course to which the package being evaluated belongs.
* **Package name:** This is the name of the package being evaluated. It is advised to keep this short but clear. For example, if the course is called "Captain's Career Course", use verbiage such as "CCC Module 1 Exam" or "CCC Module 1 Lesson 1" rather than full package titles.
* **Business Rules:** Each of the business rules outlined in the Army Business Rules and Best Practices Guide for SCORM 2004 CMI DL Development is presented with the following:
  * **Rating:** This describes whether a rule has been satisfied or not, or if it is not applicable to the package being evaluated.
  * **Additional comments:** Each entry presents a text field for providing any extra comments.
* **Evaluator name:** This is the name of the person performing the final evaluation on this package.
* **Organization name:** This is the name of the organization that the person named above represents.

Upon completing the web form, the evaluator can generate a pre-formatted checklist that should be saved as a PDF (through the browser's Print function). This PDF will be included as part of the package deliverables.
