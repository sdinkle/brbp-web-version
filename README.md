# Army Business Rules Online Checklist for SCORM 2004 3rd Edition CMI
This web form is an online version of the [Army BRBP SCORM 2004 CMI Checklist](https://tadlp.github.io/brbp/). It is intended for use by the ADLPA's designated point-of-contact upon completing development of a DL package before submitting it to the Army.

The web form contains fields for the following information:

* **Course and Package Information:** This section addresses information about the content package being evaluated and contains the following:
  * **Course name:** Enter the name of the course to which the package being evaluated belongs.
  * **Package name:** Enter the name of the package being evaluated. It is advised to keep this short but clear. For example, if the course is called "Captain's Career Course", use wording such as "CCC Module 1 Exam" or "CCC Module 1 Lesson 1" rather than full package titles.
  * Answer the questions presented in order to automatically disable rules that do not apply to the content package.
* **Business Rules:** Each of the business rules outlined in the Army Business Rules and Best Practices Guide for SCORM 2004 CMI DL Development is presented with the following:
  * **Rating:** Select Yes if the rule has been satisfied or No if it has not.
  * **Additional comments:** Enter any extra comments into the text field provided. If No was selected above, use this field to explain why that rating was selected.
* **Evaluator name:** Enter the full name of the person performing the final evaluation on this package.
* **Organization name:** Enter the name of the organization that the person above represents.

Upon completing the web form, you can generate a pre-formatted checklist that should be saved as a PDF through the browser's Print function, electronically signed (using software such as Adobe Reader), and included as part of the package's deliverables.

When creating more than one checklist, you can simply leave the generated checklist open and change the information on the web form. When you select "Generate Checklist" again, the checklist will update with the new information. Use this method to quickly generate multiple checklists at a time.

**Please note:** To minimize the risk of visual irregularities, you should ensure that you access this form using an up-to-date web browser. For best results, it is recommended that you use Google Chrome. It is *strongly* recommended that you access this form using a browser other than Internet Explorer.
