# Army Business Rules Online Checklist for SCORM 2004 3rd Edition CMI
This web form is an online version of the [Army BRBP SCORM 2004 CMI Checklist](https://tadlp.github.io/brbp/). It is intended for use by the ADLPA's designated point-of-contact upon completing development of a DL package before submitting it to the Army.

The web form contains fields for the following information:

* **Course and Package Information:** This section addresses information about the content package being evaluated and contains the following:
  * **Course name:** Enter the name of the course to which the package being evaluated belongs.
  * **Package name:** Enter the name of the package being evaluated. It is advised to keep this short but clear. For example, if the course is called "Captain's Career Course", use wording such as "CCC Module 1 Exam" or "CCC Module 1 Lesson 1" rather than full package titles.
  * Answer the questions presented in order to automatically disable rules that do not apply to the content package.
    * **Does this content package include an auto-scoring assessment that reports a score to the host Learning System?** Select Yes if completion of this package reports a numerical score to the Learning System that will be displayed to the learner and/or instructor outside of the content (e.g. in a transcript). This is typically true of pretest or posttest packages, but may also be true for other content packages, depending on instructional needs.
    * **If not, does this content package serve as an introduction to a module or course?** Many courses contain some form of introductory content that explains to a learner what they can expect from a course; these packages frequently make reference to course structure, such as module or lesson numbers, and therefore are exempt from Business Rule 1.1.1. Select Yes if this package serves as an introduction to any instructional content.
* **Business Rules:** Each of the business rules outlined in the Army Business Rules and Best Practices Guide for SCORM 2004 CMI DL Development is presented with the following:
  * **Rating:** Select Yes if the rule has been satisfied or No if it has not.
  * **Additional comments:** Enter any extra comments into the text field provided. If No was selected above, use this field to explain why that rating was selected.
* **Evaluator name:** Enter the full name of the person performing the final evaluation on this package.
* **Organization name:** Enter the name of the organization that the person above represents.

Upon completing the web form, select the **Generate Checklist** button to generate a pre-formatted checklist based on the information and responses you provided.

* **Save this page as a PDF through your browser's Print function.**
* You will then have to **electronically sign** the document in the space provided at the bottom of the checklist using PDF-signing software such as Adobe Reader.
* Once you have signed the checklist, include it as part of the package's deliverables.

**Tip:** When creating more than one checklist, you can simply leave the generated checklist open and change the information on the web form. When you select the **Generate Checklist** button again, the checklist will update with the new information. Use this method to quickly generate multiple checklists at a time.

**Please note:** To minimize the risk of visual irregularities, you should ensure that you access this form using an up-to-date web browser. For best results, it is recommended that you use Google Chrome. It is *strongly* recommended that you access this form using a browser other than Internet Explorer.
