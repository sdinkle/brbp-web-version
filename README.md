# (DEFUNCT) Army Business Rules Online Checklist for SCORM 2004 3rd Edition CMI
This web form was an online version of the Army BRBP SCORM 2004 CMI Checklist. It was intended for use by the ADLPA's designated point-of-contact upon completing development of a DL package before submitting it to the Army. To my knowledge, the online checklist is no longer in use or has been moved elsewhere. You can access my version of the web form [here](https://sdinkle.github.io/brbp-web-version/).

Since I am no longer affiliated with ArmyU, this repository remains here mainly for historical purposes as well as serving as part of my portfolio. If you are looking for an actively maintained and operational version of this checklist, please contact an appropriate ArmyU POC directly for assistance.
