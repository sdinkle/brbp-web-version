planned milestones
- Monday: mockup of web form and print view
 - minimal styling
 - dummy data/rules
- Tuesday: basic JS functionality with dummy data
 - two sections, two rules each
 - pass data, present in appropriate table view
 - ensure that any fields/rules added to the web form are automatically
   reflected in the table view (i.e. automatic population)
- Wednesday: styling
 - use same styling as on the brbp website
- Thursday: enter all business rules
- Friday: testing, final graphical touches

things to keep in mind
- required fields
 - course name
 - package name
 - each radio group
 - evaluator name
- bounds checking/max length for text fields
 - appropriate text wrapping/sizing for comment fields
- sanitize text to prevent XSS shenanigans
- Allow for spaces in ruleSectionName
- iterate over each rule and section when constructing printable view
 - read headings/business rules from JSON file
- printing background color
 - https://defuse.ca/force-print-background.htm
- meta/brbp website
 - make distinction between excel- and web-based checklists on brbp site
  - excel checklist should be provided up-front and encouraged to be used by
    vendors during development
  - web-based checklist should be used after development
   - specify that checklist should be printed and submitted as a PDF file for
     delivery
 - graceful erroring when things go wrong (e.g. malformed data structure)
  - error logging in console
 - take slow connections into account

ideas for additional functionality for future versions
- Vue.js for ease of editing
- collapsible/expandable comments sections
- in-browser digital signature functionality
- automatic printing to PDF upon page entry
- templates for lesson content, exam, and combination packages

- launch new window, construct print view html programmatically through JS
 - idea: launch checklistOutput page, populate existing elements with data from web form
  - messy: there's some race-condition stuff that I don't want to deal with right now
